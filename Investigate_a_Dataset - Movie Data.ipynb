    "> **Tip**: Welcome to the Investigate a Dataset project! You will find tips in quoted sections like this to help organize your approach to your investigation. Before submitting your project, it will be a good idea to go back through your report and remove these sections to make the presentation of your work as tidy as possible. First things first, you might want to double-click this Markdown cell and change the title so that it reflects your dataset and investigation.\n",

    "> **Tip**: In this section of the report, provide a brief introduction to the dataset you've selected for analysis. At the end of this section, describe the questions that you plan on exploring over the course of the report. Try to build your report around the analysis of at least one dependent variable and three independent variables. If you're not sure what questions to ask, then make sure you familiarize yourself with the dataset, its variables and the dataset context for ideas of what to explore.\n",

    "> If you haven't yet selected and downloaded your data, make sure you do that first before coming back here. In order to work with the data in this workspace, you also need to upload it to the workspace. To do so, click on the jupyter icon in the upper left to be taken back to the workspace directory. There should be an 'Upload' button in the upper right that will let you add your data file(s) to the workspace. You can then click on the .ipynb file name to come back here.\n",

    ">This dataset contains data related to thousands of movies. This includes the budget for the movies, the revenue earned, the genres, actors, directors, and ratings. In this report I will investigate different aspects of this movie data such as the relationship between budget and revenue, the most popular genres, and the relationship between different genres and revenue. These data points could all give valuable insight into which movies are the most popular and which movies will earn the most revenue.\n"

They could be missing their values because the movies were very low budget, so the mean values of all movies may be too high. As a result I will drop these null values from investigation.)"

Alternatively, you can download the html report via the **File** > **Download as** submenu and then manually upload it to the workspace directory.

    "My findings show that in the database the genre that was most prevalent in the movie data was Drama, and comedies are the second most prevalent. However, based on a multilinear regression it doesn't seem that either of these genres had a stasticially significant relationship with revenue. Most of my research was regarding how different aspects would impact the revenue a film earned. In one regression it showed that budget and revenue are positively correlated. Could that be because the movies were higher quality? Could films with bigger budgets market more? Those could be explored later. I also explored the rating data for all of the movies. The distribution of the ratings seems to be close to normal, with the reviewers not favoring high or low ratings. The final regression looked into the relationship between runtime in revenue. No statistically significant relationship was found between these variables. Perhaps viewers are agnostic to the length of movies."
